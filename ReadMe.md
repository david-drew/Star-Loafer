# Star Loafer


### Godot 4.5 (mostly gdscript) project
### 2D Space Exploration game

This is a very early release with mostly working galaxy and system procgen.  Maps and a simple flight mode are also functioning.


### Progress
	New faction system with procgen in progress.
	NPC spawns with minimal AI in progress.

### TODO
Asteroid Belt Update
	There are currently two conflicting asteroid scenes/scripts:
		- Old style: asteroid.tscn & script
		- New: asteroid_2.tscn & script

	The new one generates ~300 interactive asteroids with sprites per belt, and the rest are just decorative (particle shader).
	The new one also needs testing, which is why it hasn't been integrated yet.
