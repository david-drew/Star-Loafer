# Previous Docs Guide

Quick map of legacy/specialized design docs. These are not currently in active development but remain important references.

- **Away Team mode** (future feature):
  - `Away Team - AI Design — Outline.md`
  - `Away Team - Away Mission Template Sets (Design Doc).md`
  - `Away Team - Dungeon Procgen - Biomes & Hazards.md`
  - `Away Team - Faction Outpost Mission Design (Quick Reference).md`
- **Comms system**:
  - `Design Doc — Star Loafer Comms System (Phase 1).md` — phase-1 comms flow, templates, and behaviors.
  - `Comms_Design.md` — additional comms scenarios and signal hooks.
- **Economy**:
  - `Economy_Specification.md` — core economy design, commodities, markets, profiles.
- **AI flight**:
  - `Flight-Mode FSM Companion Doc.md` — early flight/AI state machine notes (needs modernization).
- **Misc**:
  - `Trade Goods.txt` — commodity notes.

When touching comms/economy/AI flight, consult the relevant entries here alongside the current system docs. Away Team docs are parked until that mode is scheduled.
